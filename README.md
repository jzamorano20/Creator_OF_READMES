## Description
    When you start make sure you open the integrated terminal on the file you want in this case it would be the index.js file. After youll install inquirer in the terminal and run node index.js 
    When you run and install iquirer and get it up and running youll be able to use node index.js to get the prompts in the terminal. Once you answer the questions it should generate a README.MD with the answers you gave.
  
## Installation
You needed to install inquirer using npm i or install inquirer in the terminal and make sure you have the correct file integrated in the terminal to be able to run and install it. You'll also need to download jest. Make sure when they download you can see them in the package.json file under depenedencies.
